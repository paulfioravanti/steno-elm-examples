# Steno Demo Artefacts

This directory contains the following files:

- [Demo script][]: This is what I used as my guide through the demo. In this
  case, it just includes what code/text I should write in what order. See my
  other demo repos for more involved scripts.
- [Tape Output][]: This is the unedited output of all the steno keystrokes I
  made during the demo. If you would like more information on how to actually
  read the output, [Stanley Sakai][]'s video [Stan's Quick and Dirty: How
  Stenography Works][] is a _fantastic_ primer for this, as well as being a
  great introduction to stenography in general.
- [Demo snippets][]: My general purpose vim snippets are located in [my vim
  snippets repo][]. For this demo, I used one "cheat" snippet to save me
  the trouble of writing a full Dict worth of key-value pairs (and save you
  from having to watch it...). Aside from that "cheat", all other code was
  written "freehand" steno without any copy/paste.
